# T9 Exercise

Map strings of digits to potential alphanumeric character strings
using the T9 telephone keypad.

## Background

### Keypad

The keypad on most touch tone telephones and cell phones has a grid of digits (0-9).
Most of the digits are also associated with a set of letters:

| digit | characters |
| :---: | :---: |
| 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | A B C |
| 3 | D E F |
| 4 | G H I |
| 5 | J K L |
| 6 | M N O |
| 7 | P Q R S |
| 8 | T U V |
| 9 | W X Y Z |

### Mapping

An area code (e.g. `206`) can be mapped through the T9 keypad:

| 2 | 0 | 6 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| A | 0 | M |
| B |   | N |
| C |   | O |

to a set of alphanumeric strings:

    A0M   A0N   A0O
    B0M   B0N   B0O
    C0M   C0N   C0O

## Exercise

### Basic

The basic exercise is to write an algorithm to print all possible mappings
generated by a sequence of digits (e.g. `206`) mapped via the T9 keypad.
For example:

    206 ->
      A0M
      A0N
      A0O
      B0M
      B0N
      B0O
      C0M
      C0N
      C0O

### Extra Credit

Given an array of English words, how would you post-process the list of strings
generated in the basic step looking for non-overlapping English words.
Characters _not_ in an English word would be reverted to digits.
For example:

    2069936413 -> b0myxdogle -> 20my9dog13
